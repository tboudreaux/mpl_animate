Help on class autoAnimation in mplEasyAnimate:

mplEasyAnimate.autoAnimation = class autoAnimation(builtins.object)
 |  AutoAnimation class. This class requires will take in a matplotib figure
 |  object and add it to an frame buffer. The frame buffer will get dumped into
 |  an Imageio open video file once it is full.
 |  
 |  Attributes:
 |      filename: Filename to write animation too [str]
 |      total: The total number of frames that will be in the final animation [int]
 |      size: X, Y dimensions of image (x, y) [float tuple] [default first frame size]
 |      framebuffer: The size of the framebuffer to use [int] [default 10]
 |      pbar: Use tqdm progress bar [bool] [default False]
 |      mbs: image macro_block_size to use [int] [default 16]
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __del__(self)
 |      Invocation of safe close on descope of animation object.
 |  
 |  __init__(self, filename, total, pbar=False, size=None, framebuffer=10, mbs=16)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  __len__(self)
 |      len overload
 |      
 |      Returns:
 |          total number of frames currently in AutoAnimation
 |  
 |  __repr__(self)
 |      Auto Animation repr, returns composed animation repr.
 |  
 |  add_frame(self, frame)
 |      User Facing method to add frame to AutoAnimation
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          frame: matplotlig figure to become nth frame in animation [figure]
 |      
 |      Raises:
 |          IndexError: If you try and add more frames than total to and AutoAnimation is Open
 |          EnviromentError: If you try and add a frame when AutoAnimation has closed
 |  
 |  close(self)
 |      Safe Termination of AutoAnimation, no more frames can be added once this is called.
